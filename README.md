  * from PsyBlog - The most popular explanation in the research is that names are essentially arbitrary and meaningless. For most of us our names give away few clues about our appearance, our personalities or anything about us, except maybe a rough age, ethnicity, social class and whether our parents were celebrities (hello ‘Moon Unit’, ‘Tu Morrow’ and ‘Moxie Crimefighter’—yes, all real names of celebrity offspring).
  If, for example, I was called ‘The Pink Panther’, and I happened to look like a pink panther, you’d almost certainly find it easy to remember my name.
  * if my name was Sorta-tall Whiteguy With Glasses people would probably remember my name easier than Andrew.
